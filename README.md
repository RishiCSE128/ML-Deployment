## Startups
1. Gather / Assess 

   Gather
      * The requirements, goals and objectives
      * Understand the AI/ML use case(s)
      * Understand the current infrastructure requirements
      * Understand the deployment expectations (Budget, timescales, resources)
   
   Assess
      * The current AI/ML model
      * The maturity of the code
      * The current available infrastructure
      * The current data pipeline (if any)
      * The Data dependencies
      * The size of the current dataset
      * If current data is real or synthetic
      * The data source for model in production
      * Skills availability within the organisation
3. Plan / Design
      * Design the potential deployment pipeline
      * Plan the deployment strategy
      * Plan the metrics to be monitored
4. Execute
      * Deploy the model
      * Review the deployment strategy
5. Evaluate / Review
      * Monitor the metrics of the model
      * Observability - Model health, Data health and Service health
